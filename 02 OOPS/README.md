# [:books:](#) Object Oriented Programming

“We are programmer it is very obvious that we will solve real-world problems with a programming approach, For that we will use concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. Object-oriented programming focuses on how to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, etc in programming.
OOP simplifies the software development Phase and maintenance by providing all these concepts.”

* These concepts solved all the problems we faced in procedure-oriented programming which is very tough to manage if code grows as project size grows, OOP makes development and maintenance easier.
* In OOPS we are having Class and objects Whereas in procedure-oriented programming we have struct and union which is not secure i.e data can be accessed from anywhere.
* We can simulate any kind of real-world problem solving with an Object-Oriented Programming approach. 
* Thanks to the ubiquity of Object-Oriented Programming languages where we can reuse the code which we had written once (inheritance).
* Very easily we will be able to identify the error we have modularity for easier troubleshooting. That’s the beauty of encapsulation, Objects are self-contained.
* With the help of object-oriented programming’s sweet polymorphism, we can make codes more flexible because a single function can shape-shift to adapt to whichever class it’s in.
* OOPS is very effective in problem-solving A language like C has an amazing legacy in programming history, but writing software in a top-down language is really hectic, The more lines of code it gets, the greater the chance it will collapse.
* Let’s see what are the advantages of OOP (Re-usability, Data Redundancy, Code Maintenance, Security, Design Benefits, Better productivity, Easy troubleshooting, Polymorphism Flexibility, Problems solving, and many other advantages we have over POP)
* When you need to solve complex programming challenges seriously you should be skilled in oops concepts.
