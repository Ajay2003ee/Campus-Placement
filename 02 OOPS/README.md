“We are programmer it is very ovious that we will solve real-world problems with programming approach, For that we will use concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Object-oriented programming focus on how to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation etc in programming.
OOP simplifies the software development Phase and maintenance by providing all these concepts.”

* These concepts solved all the problems we faced in procedure-oriented programming which is very tough to manage if code grows as project size grows, OOP makes development and maintenance more easier.
* In OOPS we are having Class and objects Whereas in procedure-oriented programming we have struct and union which is not secure i.e data can be accessed from anywhere.
* We can simulate any kind of real-world problem solution with Object Oriented Programming approach. 
* Thanks to the ubiquity of Object Oriented Programming languages where, we can resuse the code which we had written once (inheritance).
* Very easily we will be able to identify the error we have modularity for easier troubleshooting. That’s the beauty of encapsulation, Objects are self-contained.
* With the help object-oriented programming’s sweet polymorphism we can make codes more flexible, because a single function can shape-shift to adapt to whichever class it’s in.
* OOPS is very effective in problem solving  A language like C has an amazing legacy in programming history, but writing software in a top-down language is really a hectic,The more lines of code it gets, the greater the chance it will collapse.
* Let’s see what are the advantages of OOP (Re-usability, Data Redundancy, Code Maintenance, Security, Design Benefits, Better productivity, Easy troubleshooting, Polymorphism Flexibility, Problems solving and many other advantages we have over POP)
* When you need to solve complex programming challenges seriously you should be skilled in oops concepts.
